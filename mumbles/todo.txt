alright basic game done need to do some fixes(in terms of priportiy):
    hiiiii reviewr hows it goin

make the thing falling down be a bit slower
    change fall incrementation speed - speeds up too quickly atm
    start at 1 line per 3 seconds then slowly start falling faster 
    or smth else idk

add levels:
    current game loop way too short
    either survive 30 seconds or smth else

let the player move a bit quicker
    Create a playerspeed variable and change it while time changes?
    or based on how long they hold the movement key
    OH WAIT I CAN USE SHIFT KEY

add obstacles/powerups?
    for example maybe bombs that explode 
    super mario start thingy
    obstacle that makes you move faster

beginner tutorial
    Id say maybe just like text appearing on the screen and showing how to play
    Show powerups working and how to move 


I WANNA MAKE A TOUHOU TYPE GAME SO BAD MAN
but that doesnt work with falling theme tho
